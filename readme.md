TODO:
- Axis must stand independent of data.
- Multiple uploads
- Ability to remove an individual from the graph
- Individual data point must be within their own group in the same SVG
- Link table with group (individual data)
- Comparison mode vs individual mode
- Comparison mode by rank
- Comparison mode by time
- Make things hideable/simpler for comparison mode
- Add additional explainer 

Constraints, Human factors:
- Do not allow comparison mode for different ranks
- Constrain start date to oldest record
- Show table in Individual mode only -- replace with comparison controls

-- It's probably time to start using redux to manage state
